# Introduction:
In our daily life Water plays a vital role in our Economy. The Availability of water in city tank is one of the important thing for every cities. If the Water level in tank is too low,our system will turn ON 2 motor,if the level is nornal,our system will turn ON 1 Motor,if level is high,our system turn OFF all the motors. Since Water is the most essential thing,so our system will continiously maintain the level.

# Features:
1.Detects the Water level in the city tank and Manipulate the Motor state with respect to the level with displaying the User via LCD display.

2.Available in low cost and in smaller sizes.

3.Simple circuit design and easy to understand.

# 4W'S and 1H:
## What?
* It is a Motor control based project which detects the city Tank's water level and Motor State to the User.
## WHY?
* Its a good habit to keep our Daily water usage normal and also it is very needed for everyone to know the need of saving water so the system like ours will be a first step in Saving water and electricity in every cities. 
## WHERE?
* We can use it in every Cities, Villages and also every Water storing Sectors.
## WHO?
*  It is an automated detector, So no need for any manual involvement to reset to normal value so every one who needs can use it.
## HOW?
* A sensor(3 digital sensing switches(one at the bottom,one at the middle,one at the top)) which is the main part of this project, It is the one which detects and transmits the value.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
## Strength:
- Its strength is compact in size.
- Accuracy in displaying the correct Motor state.
- Automated Motor control.
- Cost efficient.
## Weakness:
- Due to the usage of electronic components in a Water Reserve, we need to be very careful in creating a Water-resistant environment.
## Opportunity:
- We should create an opportunity to make our product used by everyone by providing an awareness over the wastage of water and electricity due to less user attention and importance of surveiling the Motor for atmost care.
- Due to current Water demanding situation now it is needed everywhere in the world.
## Threat:
- Now there are many new developing devices for competition in the Water level controlling sector.
