## ABSTRACT

Water is very precious for the living beings and scarcity of the same is gradually increasing. Most of the cities in the county and that of the world are facing this problem. This is one of the motivations for the current work and to deploy techniques in order to save water and help the environment which in turn ensures water for the future. Hence, it is of utmost importance to preserve and save water. In many houses there exists unnecessary wastage of water due to overflow from overhead tanks etc. Automatic Water Level Controller can provide a solution to this problem. Present work does not use any microcontrollers etc. The operation of water level controller is based on the fact that water conducts electricity. As the water level rises or fall the sensing probes and circuits of the controller detect the same. These signals are used to switch ON or switch OFF the pump motor as per requirements. This system is used to automate the process of water pumping to over-head tank storage and has the facility to select the level of water to pump. The logical situations using electronic circuit manage the system. The required amount or volume of water can be pumped to the over head tank by choosing level selector unlike waiting for the complete filling in the conventional circuits.
